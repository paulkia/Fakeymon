Dag nab you doe doppel doopers.
I have no patience to speak with you.
My favorite food is clam chowder.
Your Fakeymon are uglier than my left buttcheek.
Why am I in this shoppe?
Stop talking to me.
I am 93 years old. But I still look younger than you.
I have no purpose.
Stop being so passive-aggressive.
What do you want?
If you invest in HP, your temporary HP also rises. It's a good way to temporarily heal a Fakeymon.
I was a top chef back in my day.
You can only learn up to 5 attacks. After that, you need to replace one if you want to learn something new.
You can only store up to 10 items in your bag. Buy a new bag in the shoppe if you want to store more stuff.
The higher your speed stat, the higher chance of you landing a critical hit.
The higher your speed stat, the higher chance of you picking up an enemy's dropped item.
I was implemented on 2/21/2018.
The XP you gain per battle is calculated by the enemy's attack + defense.
If your defense stat is way too low, you'll take ridiculous damage.
Maybe if you stopped killing enemy Fakeymon, they'd drop less stuff and the world would be a less polluted place.
The higher your attack stat, the higher an enemy will be impressed and want to join your team.
I was created out of boredom of the creator.
I can say up to 23 different things.
